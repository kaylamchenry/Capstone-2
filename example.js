//DESCRIPTION:
//Your Job
//Find the sum of all multiples of n below m

//Keep in Mind
//n and m are natural numbers (positive integers)
//m is excluded from the multiples
//Examples
//sumMul(2, 9)   ==> 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
//sumMul(3, 13)  ==> 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 30
//sumMul(4, 123) ==> 4 + 8 + 12 + ... = 1860
//sumMul(4, -7)  ==> "INVALID"
